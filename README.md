This code is used to output the linguistic complexity of sequences. These sequences are limited to ATCG characters.

## This repository contains three files: 
1) a python script which reads in a .txt file of sequences (ATCG) and calculates the linguistic complexity of sequences and
outputs information to a csv

### Notes
Input: sequence of ATCG characters
Output: 
- k (substring of character sequence)
- observed kmers (number of kmers that are observed for all possible k-mer lengths)
- possible kmers (all possible k-mer lengths)

2) a python test script which tests various parameters
### Notes
Parameters include: k, string, actual_result, expected_result

3) a test .txt file to run through the python script
### Notes
A short example of the type of file to read into code
